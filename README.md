### Amby, Inc (Surge.Build) 
*Blockchain Security Engineer* | Nov 2025 – Feb 2026  
- Own end-to-end security and compliance for a Bitcoin-native credit line platform at an early-stage startup.
- Audited smart contracts and remediated 10+ vulnerabilities including reentrancy, logic errors, and access control flaws.
- Conduct mobile application penetration testing on the Surge Credit app using Kali Linux, Genymotion, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and OWASP MASVS, identifying auth, API, and data leakage risks.
- Designed and deployed Wazuh SIEM integrated with Google Cloud Platform, onboarding 25+ log sources across firewall, endpoint, and cloud layers to achieve full network and system visibility.
- Built comprehensive threat models using OWASP Threat Dragon, mapping assets, trust boundaries, and threat scenarios across blockchain, mobile, backend, and cloud layers.
- Hardened cloud networking components implementing least-privilege IAM, ACLs, and DMZ architecture aligned with CIS Controls v8 and NIST CSF, reduced attack surface across 3 production environments.
- Led secure code reviews and GitHub Advanced Security scans including SAST (Semgrep), OWASP MASVS secret detection (Gitleaks), and dependency analysis and resolved 20+ exposed API keys and secrets.
- Support regulatory and privacy compliance initiatives including GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and FinCEN, translating requirements into technical and operational controls.
- Evaluated 50+ threat data feeds, defined false positive control strategies, and authored operational runbooks enabling consistent 24x7 miscategorization coverage.
